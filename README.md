# alx-project-nexus

Welcome to the **Project Nexus Documentation** repository! This repository serves as a knowledge hub, documenting my major learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program. It showcases my understanding of backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices, while fostering collaboration with frontend and backend learners.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.
- Serve as a reference guide for current and future learners.
- Encourage collaboration between frontend and backend learners to maximize our collective potential.

## Overview of ProDev Backend Engineering Program

The ProDev Backend Engineering program has equipped me with a solid foundation in building robust, scalable backend systems. Through hands-on projects and theoretical learning, Iâ€™ve explored a variety of technologies and concepts that are critical to modern backend development.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered
- **Python**: Used as the primary programming language for backend logic and scripting.
- **Django**: Leveraged for building RESTful APIs and managing the Movie Recommendation Hub backend.
- **REST APIs**: Implemented endpoints (e.g., `/api/movies/trending/`, `/api/favorites/`) with authentication and pagination.
- **GraphQL**: Explored as an alternative to REST for flexible data querying (not fully implemented but studied).
- **Docker**: Containerized the backend for consistent deployment environments.
- **CI/CD**: Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.

### Important Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design**: Modeled relationships between `User`, `Movie`, and `FavoriteMovie` with PostgreSQL, using indexes for performance.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Applied retry logic and caching to handle TMDb API rate limits.
- **Caching Strategies**: Implemented Redis caching for trending and recommended movies to reduce API calls.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
- **Challenge**: TMDb API rate limits caused frequent 429 errors.
  - **Solution**: Added exponential backoff retry logic (up to 3 attempts) and cached responses in Redis for 1 hour.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring secure authentication.
  - **Solution**: Integrated JWT authentication with `rest_framework_simplejwt`, including token refresh and secure cookie settings.
- **Challenge**: Deployment consistency across environments.
  - **Solution**: Used Docker and environment variables to align local and Heroku deployments.

### Best Practices and Personal Takeaways
- **Best Practices**:
  - Followed DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) by centralizing API logic in `utils.py`.
  - Implemented logging (e.g., `logging.info`) for debugging and monitoring.
  - Used Swagger (`drf_yasg`) for API documentation and testing.
- **Takeaways**:
  - Caching significantly improves performance but requires careful expiration management.
  - Collaboration with frontend teams is crucial for aligning API design with UI needs.
  - Security (e.g., JWT, HTTPS) is non-negotiable in production environments.

## Collaboration - Key to Success

### Collaborate With Whom?
- **Fellow ProDev Backend Learners**: Exchange ideas, share code snippets, and organize study/coding sessions to deepen our understanding.
- **ProDev Frontend Learners**: Partner with them as they will use my Movie Recommendation Hub API endpoints (e.g., `/api/movies/trending/`) for their projects. Letâ€™s build synergies!

### Where to Collaborate?
- **Dedicated Discord Channel**: #ProDevProjectNexus
  - Connect with both frontend and backend learners.
  - Share ideas, ask/answer questions, and stay updated with staff announcements.

### ProDev Tip!
- Use the first week (July 21-27, 2025) to:
  - Communicate that Iâ€™m developing the Movie Recommendation Hub.
  - Identify ProDev Frontend learners working on related projects (e.g., UI for movie recommendations) for seamless collaboration.

## Next Steps

- Continue refining the Movie Recommendation Hub API documentation.
- Share this repository link with collaborators in #ProDevProjectNexus.
- Prepare for the auto review by July 28, 2025, 1:00 AM EEST.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
